# Javascript and HTML + Mapping

This repo holds my final project for [this class](https://github.com/CPLN692-MUSA611) that I audited at Penn in the Spring of 2017.

Here is the site published to [github pages](https://rossbernet.github.io/penn_final/)

Here is a screenshot for good measure:

The site is based on a handful of [mapboxGL demos](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/examples/) stitched together and searchable using a nice [bootstrap](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/navs/#tabs) framework.
