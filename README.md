# Javascript and HTML + Mapping

This repo holds my final project for this class that I audited at Penn in the Spring of 2017.

I tried publishing it to github pages, but I got impatient. I will fix it...soon. But wanted to wrap something else up dependent on this.

So here is a screenshot:

The site is based on a handful of [mapboxGL demos](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/examples/) stitched together and searchable using a nice [bootstrap](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/navs/#tabs) framework.
